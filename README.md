# json-api project

For All My Naruto Fans...

Welcome!!! Here is all there is to know about your favorite show...Naruto!

Here's how this API works...


With https://sd-json-api-project.herokuapp.com, the user starts at the root url/directory that redirects to https://sd-json-api-project.herokuapp.com/Naruto.

Once the user gets to the route url/directory, the user can find all the different versions of Naruto movies, tv shows, and etc.

The user can type https://sd-json-api-project.herokuapp.com/Naruto and add any of the id numbers provided to the end of the url to find a specfic document.

New documents are created and added for the user to view.

Documents, like the scores, are updated frequently.

Documents that become irrelevent are also deleted frequently.

This API is based on the Jikan Anime API.


For the website...


When the user clicks on the 'Show' button, the user will be be able to see information about one of the  many movies, tv shows, and etc of Naruto. 

Below, the user is able to update and delete information for each by simply clicking 'Update' or 'Delete'. With 'Update', the user can update the provided form to update the information, while 'Delete' deletes the form. 

The user can also create their own form by clicking, 'Create', where the user can add their own information regarding a new Naruto movies, tv shows, and etc.
